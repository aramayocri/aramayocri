# Hello everyone, I'm Cristian.
<p align="center"><img src="code-python.png" alt="portada"></p>

With more than 15 years of experience in the technology industry, I am currently working as a Python Developer, using technologies such as DRF, PostgreSQL and Docker, among others.

I enjoy solving problems and I have a passion for creation. I strive for my work to have a positive impact on people's lives and contribute to innovation.

Throughout my career, I have honed my programming and problem solving skills, allowing me to thrive in rapidly changing environments. I am always eager to gain new knowledge and stay up to date on the latest advancements and technological trends.

Since I am also interested in data science and artificial intelligence, you can find some notebooks in my repository.

If you want to collaborate on innovative projects or need help with application development using Python, feel free to contact me. I am excited to be a part of projects that advance technology and improve people's lives.
